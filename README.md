#Getaway Destination - Second Milestone Project
[View my project](https://timeakovacs86.github.io/Getawaydestination/)

This website is my second Milestone project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)
The main goal was to create a simple website which using the technologies that I got familiar with in the second phase and it's based on Java Script and its jQuery library and also on Google API libraries.
The website itself help us to find cities around the world and get back a list of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, museums and some other tourist attractions what would be useful, planning a vacation upfront.
We can see those places position on the map with markers to find them and plan the daily itinerary through the holiday around that area.
This is a single page website therefore very simple and easy to use, no need of any special technical skills to use it.
The results of our search is just one click away, it is also easy to use with one hand on our phones.

## UX

This website is created for everybody who wants to find a great weekend getaway destination.
I choose as a background picture the Fisherman's Bastion (Budapest, Hungary), because that's the city I am from, also I tried to use the background pictures colors, to ensure that this site has a user friendly and smooth surface.
The website is responsive, so it gives the same excellent user experience while you use it on a PC, tablet or mobile device with the same functionality.
